# food2u

Food2u is a web app in which one can look for recipes, get the list of ingredients for any selected recipe and then the app will generate a shopping list for said ingredients. It also has a user system in which one can create an account, or log on, to select and save recipes as "favorites." 

Food2u was the first group project built for our full-stack bootcamp. The team behind the project was: Edgar Burelo, Raghava Lakshminarayana, Elianne Islas and Jose Antonio Alvarado.

To build the app, we mostly used standard front-end technologies such as Bootstrap and jQuery. We also used Google Firebase for the user system and the EDAMAM API to get the recipes. It was also our first experience with making something significantly larger than what we were doing in class and for homework assignments. So, we also had to learn about Git and used it extensively throughout. 

Overall, it was a fun first project to work on. It put all our skills that we had been learning in the first two months of the bootcamp to the test.
